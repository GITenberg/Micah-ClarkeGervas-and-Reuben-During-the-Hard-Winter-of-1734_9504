description: "Micah Clarke is an historical adventure novel by British author Arthur\
  \ Conan Doyle, published in 1889 and set during the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685 in\
  \ England. The book is a bildungsroman whose protagonist, Micah Clarke, begins as\
  \ a boy seeking adventure in a rather romantic and naive way, falls under the influence\
  \ of an older and vastly experienced, world-weary soldier of fortune, and becomes\
  \ a grown up after numerous experiences, some of them very harrowing. In the process\
  \ the book also records much of the history of the Monmouth Rebellion, from the\
  \ point of view of someone living in 17th century England.\nMuch of the focus is\
  \ upon the religious dimension of the conflict. The Rebellion was prompted by the\
  \ desire of many to replace the Catholic King James with a Protestant rival. Micah\
  \ is the son of a committed Protestant father who sends Micah to fight in the same\
  \ cause which he himself had fought in during the English Civil War. Micah fights\
  \ at the Battle of Sedgemoor, which in a narrative aside Doyle obliquely acknowledges\
  \ to be the last clear-cut pitched battle on open ground between two military forces\
  \ fought on English soil; Micah also witnesses the execution of James Scott on Tower\
  \ Hill.\nMuch is made of the role of Protestant ministers in recruiting the rebel\
  \ army and in motivating its soldiers. Micah Clarke himself becomes increasingly\
  \ disillusioned with religious extremism and ultimately expresses the view that\
  \ toleration is a great good. Conan Doyle had himself been brought up as a Catholic\
  \ and it is likely that Micah expresses his own thoughts on the subject.\n\n\n From\
